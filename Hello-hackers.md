## BOBA testnet

One of the most common questions we get at hackathons is whether Boba has a testnet. 

And the answer is ‚ú®¬†YES ‚ú®¬†!

### Getting Rinkeby ETH on Boba Network

The first step to getting Rinkeby ETH on Boba Network is to have Rinkeby ETH on L1.

If you don‚Äôt have Rinkeby ETH on L1 you can get it with one of these Rinkeby faucets:

- [https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)
- [https://rinkebyfaucet.com/](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/)
- [https://faucet.rinkeby.io/](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
- [https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet](https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet)
- [https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby)

Once you have L1 Rinkeby ETH you  you have to bridge it through the Boba Network Rinkeby gateway to o get it to the Boba Network (L2).

## How to deploy on Boba?

### Deploying a simple ERC20 contract on Boba

[ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) otherwise known as token standard is one of the simplest known standard contracts. We have published a guide on how to deploy one to our network using Truffle.

- [Deploy with Truffle](https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba/tree/develop/boba_examples/truffle-erc20)

With the rising popularity of Boba Network we managed to garner some unique tokens which new hackers can use as inspiration or reference:

- [$BOBA](https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba/blob/develop/packages/boba/contracts/contracts/DAO/governance-token/BOBA.sol)
- [$SHIBUI](https://github.com/ShibuiDAO/shibui/blob/main/src/contracts/shibui/Shibui.sol)
- [$BRE](https://github.com/BobaBrewery/brewery-contarcts/blob/main/contracts/BreToken.sol)
- [$OLO](https://blockexplorer.boba.network/address/0x5008F837883EA9a07271a1b5eB0658404F5a9610/contracts)
- [$YOLO](https://blockexplorer.boba.network/address/0xb828dfc55B4883C6C587C1404F91af3cDbe94C14/contracts)
- [$BDOGE](https://blockexplorer.boba.network/address/0x121636C43E96D97AB00B6c6994cDDEBEf27dE1C7/contracts)

### Deploying a simple ERC721 contract on Boba

Boba Network prides itself on supporting NFTs, [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), so it‚Äôs no surprise that we managed to get many collections to join us.

If users want to create a simple and unique NFT collection they can simply follow in our footsteps via the Turing Monsters collection found [here](https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba/tree/develop/boba_community/turing-monsters).

Some other popular collections that can serve as an inspiration are:

- [Boba Punks](https://blockexplorer.boba.network/address/0x3CA6F1D2F935752d16121895378ff4898db71B04/contracts)
- [Boba Apes](https://blockexplorer.boba.network/address/0xcfD526e356c61f581F8f4685B8440dAE70f61D43/contracts)
- [MedievalDAO](https://medievaldao.games/)
- [Turing Monsters](https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba/tree/develop/boba_community/turing-monsters)
- [Hedgey OTC futures](https://github.com/hedgey-finance/NFT_OTC_Core/blob/main/contracts/FuturesNFT.sol)
